This folder contains the files for making the necessary plots according to the tutorial: Dipole Correction in Quantum Espresso Part 1

 - Note: Use all the commands and scripts in the directory where the pw.x (scf) output files were generated (there must be the .save/ and .xml files)
 - Note two: None of the programs utilized (pp.x or average.x) can be run with parallel options

Instructions: 
 1. Run a scf calculation (k=gamma only if desired) of the slab in order to obtain the electrostatic potential
 2. Create an empty tmp directory in the same folder where the pw.x job was done
 3. Run the "plot.in" file by using the pp.x program
    - this will generate a pot.dat file in the tmp/ directory you previously created
 4. Run the "avg.in" file by using average.x program
 5. Plot the data stored in the avg.dat file by using the python script "potential_vs_zdimension.py"
