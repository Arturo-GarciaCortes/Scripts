This directory contains files to fix certain atoms in a structure for a Quantum ESPRESSO relax, vc-relax or MD calculation. 

The range should be specified along the z-direction, so that if the z-coordinate of an atom is inside the range it will be fixed during the relaxation of the structure.

This code is useful mainly for slab relaxations, in order to fix certain layers of the model.
